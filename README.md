# Mini-Processor Takehome Project

This README will be filled in later; removed the initial how-to instructions for brevity and initial commit.

## Initial Setup

Please run:

1. `go mod download` to fetch dependencies
2. To use the `ginkgo` command line tool to run tests, please run `go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo`
